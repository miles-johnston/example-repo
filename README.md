- 👋 Hi, I’m Miles Johnston
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and know Java and C++ but I am eager to learn more!  Nothing in specific.  Just like learning and creating.
I am so far familiar with High School AP Computer Science subjects and a bit beyond that as I learn in my own time too on codecademy
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and C++ as well as some JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I qualify for.  I will take any experience I can get so I can find something that peaks my interest,
and to gain more experience with collaborations and work for others.
